# Metal Touch Sensor Module

#### Project Overview

The **Metal Touch Sensor Module** project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Mega with a metal touch sensor to detect the presence of metal objects. This setup is useful for applications where proximity sensing or simple metal detection is required.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Metal Touch Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Metal Touch Sensor Module to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin**: Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Metal Touch Sensor Module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for readings:
     - **Metal Detected!:** Indicates that the metal touch sensor has detected metal (output is HIGH).
     - **No Metal Detected:** Indicates that no metal is detected (output is LOW).

#### Applications

- **Proximity Sensing:** Detect the presence of metal objects in close proximity.
- **Object Detection:** Use in automated systems for detecting metallic components.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate into door locks or security systems for metal detection.

#### Notes

- Ensure the metal touch sensor module is properly calibrated and positioned for accurate detection.
- Experiment with different metal objects to understand the sensitivity and detection range of the sensor.
- Adjust the detection threshold or sensitivity in the code as needed for specific applications.
